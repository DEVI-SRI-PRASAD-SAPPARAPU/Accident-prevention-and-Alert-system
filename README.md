# Accident-prevention-and-Alert-system
In the modern world of science and technology, Transportation system 
is an integral part of living. Having this with us gives us the feel of the most 
civilized creatures on the planet. Automobiles play a vital role in our daily life 
but like every other thing, with some positives there are negatives too. Road 
accidents are the major threat to human lives. Speed is the key factor 
responsible for many of the accidents. Therefore, there is a need to control all 
the accidents. 
One of the methods for accident detection was, manual accident 
detection, which relied on the passengers passing by the accident spot who 
notify the concerned emergency authorities for any safety measures to be 
taken but this method was having a loophole in it because its efficiency was 
not reliable because someone have to witness the accident also this method 
incorporates delays and inaccuracies due to witnessâ€™s expression problem. 
Despite many safety measures and programs launched by the governmental 
as well as nongovernmental organizations to make people aware of the safe 
driving concept, life claimed by these accidents are increasing at an alarming 
rate. The main goal of the system is to control the accident by alerting the 
person who is driving the car with the help of a prerecorded voice alert. So 
that driver can control the situation before it goes out of control. This objective 
will help to prevent the vehicle from accident.
